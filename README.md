# FiraCode-Retina-with-Vietnamese-characters

This is a patch for the glorious FiraCode font to support Vietnamese characters.

I am by no mean professional in modifying font, so there should have silly mistakes. FiraCode is my most beloved programming font, however apparently it does not support Vietnamese characters, so I make some modification to support those letters. This is a quick attempt to patch font (retina only, I do not know how to automate the process for other font weights). Would love switching to other better solution too if I found.
